1. Please use Google colab to run the code and on a T4 Runtime.
2. Run all can be selected to automate cell running. 
3. The code gets the new version of accelerate and will require you to restart the runtime and run all the cells. 
   The point will be indicated by the code breaking as you run all cells.
4. The cells will run one after the other so the run all can be used to automate that.
5. As the code runs new files will be created and used by the code.
6. For the data, attach the necessary files.
