# Sentiment-Analysis-in-Swahili

## Description
Kiswahili is a lingua franca spoken by 100-150 million people across East Africa. It is an official language in the DRC, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda. On social media, Swahili speakers tend to express themselves in their own local dialect. This data can help you to analyze social conversations online and determine deeper context as they apply to a topic, brand or theme. Sentiment analysis relies on multiple word senses and cultural knowledge and can be influenced by age, gender and socio-economic status. For this task, we have collected annotated Swahili sentences from Twitter. The objective of this challenge is to classify whether a Swahili sentence is of positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This is a multiclass task.
